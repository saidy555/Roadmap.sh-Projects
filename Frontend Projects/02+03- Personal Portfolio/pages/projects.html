        <h3>HTML-Only Portfolio</h3>
        <p>
          I developed a personal portfolio website using HTML5 exclusively,
          without any CSS or JavaScript. The main goal was to demonstrate a
          strong understanding of core HTML structure, semantic elements, and
          accessibility best practices.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <figcaption>
            The project features a single-page layout that includes the
            following sections:
          </figcaption>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Header: Contains the website title and navigation links using an
              unordered list (&lt;ul&gt;) and list items (&lt;li&gt;).
            </li>
            <li>
              About Me: A section dedicated to a brief introduction and
              professional summary.
            </li>
            <li>
              Projects: Showcases a list of projects, each with a title,
              description, and link to its corresponding page or repository. I
              used &lt;figure&gt; and &lt;figcaption&gt; to semantically group
              project images with their captions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Skills: Lists technical skills using an unordered list. Contact:
              Provides contact information and a basic contact form using the
              &lt;form&gt; element.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </figure>
        <p>
          I prioritized using semantic HTML tags like &lt;header&gt;,
          &lt;main&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;,
          &lt;figure&gt;, and &lt;figcaption&gt; to ensure the document's
          structure is meaningful and accessible to screen readers and search
          engines. All images were given descriptive alt attributes. This
          project highlights my ability to build a robust and well-structured
          web page from the ground up, a foundational skill for any web
          developer.

        <h3>Interactive Calculator</h3>
        <p>
          This project is a fully functional calculator built using HTML5, CSS3,
          and JavaScript. The primary goal was to create an intuitive and
          responsive user interface for performing basic arithmetic operations.
          The frontend is entirely self-contained, requiring no external
          libraries or frameworks.
        </p>

        <h4>HTML Structure</h4>
        <p>
          The HTML file provides the foundational structure of the calculator.
          It's built with a main container (&lt;div&gt;) that holds the display
          screen (&lt;input&gt;) and the button grid. Each button is a
          &lt;button&gt; element with a specific class to identify its function
          (e.g., operator, number, clear). This semantic structure ensures that
          the layout is logical and easy to navigate.
        </p>

        <h4>CSS Styling</h4>
        <figure>
          <figcaption>
            CSS was used to style the calculator and make it visually appealing
            and user-friendly. Key styling features include:
          </figcaption>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Grid Layout: A CSS Grid was utilized to arrange the buttons in a
              clean, organized layout. This approach makes the calculator
              responsive, ensuring it looks good on various screen sizes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Aesthetic Design: I applied custom fonts, background colors, and
              button styles to create a modern, minimalist look. Hover and
              active states were added to the buttons to provide visual feedback
              to the user.
            </li>
            <li>
              Responsiveness: Media queries were implemented to adjust the font
              sizes and button dimensions on smaller screens, ensuring a
              consistent user experience on mobile devices.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </figure>

        <h4>JavaScript Functionality</h4>
        <figure>
          <figcaption>
            JavaScript handles all the calculator's logic and interactivity. The
            script performs the following key functions:
          </figcaption>

          <li>
            Event Handling: It listens for click events on the number and
            operator buttons.
          </li>

          <li>
            State Management: It manages the state of the calculator, storing
            the current input, the previous number, and the selected operator.
          </li>

          <li>
            Calculation Logic: A function evaluates the mathematical expression
            based on the order of operations. It uses a switch statement to
            handle different operators (+, -, *, /).
          </li>

          <li>
            Display Updates: The JavaScript dynamically updates the calculator's
            display (&lt;input /&gt;) in real-time as the user inputs numbers
            and operators. It also handles edge cases like division by zero and
            multiple decimal points.
          </li>
        </figure>

        <p>
          This project showcases a solid understanding of fundamental web
          development concepts, from structuring a document with HTML to styling
          it with CSS and adding interactive functionality with JavaScript.

        <h3>Interactive Quiz Application</h3>
        <p>
          This project is a dynamic, multi-question quiz application built using
          HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The primary goal was to create an
          engaging and educational tool that presents questions, tracks user
          answers, and provides instant feedback and a final score.
        </p>
        <h4>HTML Structure</h4>
        <figure>
          <figcaption>
            The HTML file provides a clear, logical structure for the quiz. It
            includes distinct sections for the welcome screen, the quiz
            container, and the final results display. Key elements include:
          </figcaption>
          <ul>
            <li>A title and a "Start Quiz" button.</li>
            <li>
              A question container with a designated area for the question text.
            </li>
            <li>
              A list of answer choices, dynamically generated using an unordered
              list (&lt;ul&gt;).
            </li>
            <li>A status bar to show the current question number.</li>
            <li>
              A results section to display the user's score and a button to
              restart the quiz.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The HTML is semantically structured to ensure accessibility and ease
          of manipulation with JavaScript.
        </p>
        <h4>CSS Styling</h4>
        <figure>
          <figcaption>
            CSS was used to create a clean and intuitive user interface. The
            styling focuses on user experience and readability:
          </figcaption>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Layout: Flexbox was utilized to center the quiz container on the
              page and to organize the answer buttons horizontally and
              vertically. This ensures the layout is responsive and adapts well
              to different screen sizes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Visual Feedback: The buttons change color on hover to give visual
              feedback. More importantly, JavaScript dynamically adds classes to
              the buttons to style correct answers (e.g., green) and incorrect
              answers (e.g., red) after a user makes a selection.
            </li>
            <li>
              Animations: Simple CSS transitions were used to animate the
              display of new questions and the final score, making the interface
              feel more polished and dynamic.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </figure>
        <h4>JavaScript Functionality</h4>
        <figure>
          <figcaption>
            JavaScript is the core of the application, managing all the quiz
            logic and interactivity. Its main responsibilities include:
          </figcaption>
          <ul>
            <li>
              State Management: It maintains the quiz's state, tracking the
              current question index, the user's score, and the array of
              questions.
            </li>

            <li>
              Dynamic Content Generation: Upon starting the quiz, JavaScript
              dynamically renders the questions and answer choices from a
              predefined data structure (an array of objects).
            </li>

            <li>
              Event Handling: It listens for clicks on the answer buttons. When
              a user selects an answer, the script checks if it's correct,
              updates the score, provides visual feedback, and advances to the
              next question.
            </li>
            <li>
              Game Logic: The script handles the flow of the quiz. When all
              questions have been answered, it hides the quiz container and
              displays the final score and a "restart" button.
            </li>
            <li>
              Timer: An optional timer function was implemented to add an extra
              layer of challenge, tracking the time spent on the quiz and
              displaying it in the results.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </figure>
        <p>
